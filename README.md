# Instant-Messenger
Java implementation of a instant messenger
will also implement encryption algorthms to ensure secure communication line between the client and the host 


To Do List
1. Fix shit (mainly the class hierarchies) - do we rebuild from scratch?
2. Less shitty graphics and more buttons
3. Write multiple encryption methods and implement the ability to use any of them in the messenger (choose at the beginning or be able to switch while it's running?)
4. Pick one: Multithreading or connecting across different networkss
